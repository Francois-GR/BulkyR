        For people who have old furniture they no longer need and for people who could still use old furniture, BulkyR is the perfect solution. It offers kind of shelters where locals can come and bring their old furniture they don't need anymore and other locals can come and see if they could still use the furniture. In a time where vintage is a trend, it is very interesting to work this way and there is less waste and no more dirty streets.
